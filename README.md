A Discord furry bot

## A note to aspiring developers who want to self host ProtoBot

We are not supportive of the idea of people self hosting ProtoBot because the dev team has put a very high priority on providing the best experience we can. This repository will be deleted if people self-host it as they will not use the same setup to what we do and will most likely not put the same amount of effort we do. If ProtoBot is lacking a feature you'd like to see, please refer to the developing guidelines and if you can add that feature it will be in to stay.

Plus, as ProtoBot grows we will continue to rely on MANY, MANY more external services to provide it's function.
