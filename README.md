# ProtoBot

A Discord furry bot

## Woah~ You're special!

You just got access to a **top-secret** code repository.

This is where all **live work** on ProtoBot goes!

## Testing

Once you wrote some code, you should test it!

Here's what you need:

- Node.js
- npm (included with Node)

### Step 1: Config

If you haven't already, copy the `config.rename-me.ts` file to `config.ts` and then modify the configuration.

Place your bot token under `token`, and configure prefixes and such to your liking.

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies

Run `npm i`. This will download the latest dependencies, and build the `better-sqlite3` database wrapper.

### Step 3: Compiling and running

Run `npm start`. The current source code will be compiled, and then automatically ran.
