# Contributing to ProtoBot

First of all, *thank you for considering contributing*. It helps a **lot** and helps remove some of the burden from our developer team.

This file will assist you with everything you need to know about [***setting up a ProtoBot development/testing environment***](#setting-up-a-developmenttesting-environment), [***writing code that will be approved***](#writing-code-that-will-be-approved), and [***submitting your code***](#submitting-your-code).

## Setting up a development/testing environment

In order to work on ProtoBot, you need a working development environment.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

ProtoBot has some prerequisites that need to be met in order to test your new features.

#### Node.js

For ProtoBot to function, you need to install the [Node.js JavaScript Runtime](https://nodejs.org/).

Install version `12.x.x LTS`, **NOT** version `14`.

#### NPM

NPM comes built in with [Node.js](#nodejs), so there isn't a need to worry about it.

#### Enmap

ProtoBot depends on Enmap and SQLite3 for data storage. Follow the [Enmap Prerequisites Installation](https://enmap.evie.dev/install#pre-requisites) steps and then return here.

### Step 2: Installing dependencies

Now, run the command `npm install` in your terminal. This will install all of our dependencies, and build `better-sqlite3` from source. **This may take a while.**

## Writing code that will be approved

When you write your code, it should be fit enough to be merged.

Your code should be formatted with Prettier after you write it, if you don't then a bot will detect your pull request and do that for you.

Code should be reasonable, and we think you are able to understand what that means.

## Submitting your code
